"I want to build a robot." : "What would it mean to build a robot?"
"I want to understand French." : "What would it mean to understand French?"
"Do you like me?" : "What makes you think I like you?"
"You confuse me." : "What makes you think I confuse you?"

An example of when the structure doesn't work well is when you have both an instance of "I want"/"I want to" and "I...you". To fix that, I just tested for an occurance inside of the
    test for "I want"/"I want to"
